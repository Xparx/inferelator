The inferelator codebase for analyzing data one cell at a time. Currently includes [AMuSR](https://github.com/simonsfoundation/multitask_inferelator/tree/AMuSR/inferelator_ng) and elements of [InfereCLaDR](https://github.com/simonsfoundation/inferelator_ng/tree/InfereCLaDR). Proper citations will follow eventually.

To install the python packages needed for the inferelator, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. To install this package, run `python setup.py install`

To run a workflow, follow the tutorial I haven't written yet to try a runner script that I haven't written on some test data I haven't assembled yet.
